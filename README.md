# YNAB API Client

A CLI client for interacting with the [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) [API](https://api.youneedabudget.com/). It is not very feature rich right now because I'm just going to fill out my use case and then let this thing slowly rot to death.

## Usage

```sh
ynab-api-client -h
```
